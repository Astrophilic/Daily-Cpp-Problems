			SELECTION SORT

It is in place sorting algorithm.

divides list into two parts:-
sorted sublist
unsorted sublist

find minimum and swap it with ith index.
Selection sort can also be used on list structures that make add and remove efficient, such as a linked list

in selection sort , number of comparisons is more as compared to insertion sort.

we have to do sigma j operations/comparisons to find minimum element.
